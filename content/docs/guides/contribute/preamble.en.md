description: An introduction to contributing to OSRD
---

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following chapters are a set of guidelines for contributing to OSRD. These guidelines are mostly not strict rules, it's probably fine to do things slightly differently. If you have already contributed to open source projects before, you probably won't be surprised. If you have not, it will probably help a lot!

### Communicate

Chatting with other contributors is a great way to speed things up:

- [**Create an issue**](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/issues/new/choose) to discuss your contribution project.

### Inquire

Just like with any project, changes rely on past work.
Before making changes, it is best to learn about what's already there:

- [read technical documentation]({{< ref "/docs" >}})
- read the existing source code related to your project
- chat with developers who last worked on areas you are interested in

*[Continue towards initial set-up â€£]({{< ref "license-and-set-up">}})*
