The source code of OSRD is available under [the LGPLv3 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/).

Just like with any other open source project, by contributing source code, you imply the owner of the source code allows its distribution under the project's license.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
LGPLv3 forbids modifying source code without sharing the changes under the same license: use other people's work, and share yours!

This constraint does not propagate through APIs: You can use OSRD as a library, framework or API server to interface with proprietary software. Please suggest changes if you need new interfaces.
