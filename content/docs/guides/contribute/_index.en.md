First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following chapters are a set of guidelines for contributing to OSRD[^guidelines-not-rules]. If you have already contributed to open source projects before, you probably won't be surprised.
If you have not, it will probably help a lot!

### Communicate

Chatting with other contributors is a great way to speed things up:

- [**Create an issue**](https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/issues/new/choose) to discuss your contribution project
- Join our matrix instant messaging room ! **(very soon, it's not yet there)**

### Inquire

As for any project, each change is based on what has been done before.
Before making any change, learn about what's already there :

- You can [read the technical documentation]({{< ref "/docs" >}})
- It's best to read the existing code related to your project before proposing something new
- You can contact the last developers who have worked on code areas that are of interest to you

[^guidelines-not-rules]: These guidelines are mostly not strict rules, it's probably fine to do things slightly differently.
