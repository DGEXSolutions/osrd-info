The reviewer/maintainer undertakes to carry out the review quickly, and is also responsible for closing _request changes_, check commit history and quickly merge the _pull request_ if allowed.

We propose you a few tips and recommendations that we think are relevant to a human, relevant and rewarding code review for all contributors:
- [How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You?](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/) by Michael Lynch.
- [How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human? ](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) by Michael Lynch.

> If the reviewer is not maintainer, the PR's author has the responsability to contact a maintainer to merge the PR. In special cases (especially near feature freeze), maintainer should be found early.
