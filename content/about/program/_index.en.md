The OSRD Program consists of several projects that are managed and delivered as a single package.

The program's teams are organized according to the **SAFe Framework**[^SAFe] (framework for organizing agility at scale).
The organization of the program is therefore based on a Program Increment (PI), an iteration composed of 4 sprints of two weeks, followed by a consolidation and planning sprint for the next PI.
The SAFe organization involves:

- teams working in a synchronized and interdependent way
- a sustained rhythm of deliveries
- a number of roles and ceremonies
- a feedback and validation process

The steering committees, which guarantee the smooth running of the program, make it possible to

- define the project and product roadmaps
- gather needs
- define priorities
- adapt the work methodology
- issue validation reports based on the test reports submitted at the end of each Program Increment

[^SAFe]: *As the Program is still in a growth phase, the implementation of this organization is necessarily gradual, to reach its target by the end of 2022.*
