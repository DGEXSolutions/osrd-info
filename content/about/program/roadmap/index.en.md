### Short Term DCM

</font>

**Objective 1 -** Integrating the residual capacity search algorithm into OSRD

Run the algorithm in OSRD:

- Integrate the algorithm
- Integrate the algorithm into the SIPH data (infra and hourly data)
  - Import of SIPH data into OSRD
  - Projection of SIPH schedules to track
- Projection on the most likely route

**Objective 2 -** Design the POC of the mobile application
