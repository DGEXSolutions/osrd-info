One of the ambitions of OSRD is to help with **timetabling on a European scale**.

To reach this goal, OSRD has to take local features into account by consulting and collaborating with railway companies and infrastructure managers.

And for their trouble contributing to OSRD, these companies:
 - profit from all the common development efforts
 - can freely build on the common effort to achieve their own goals[^license]
 - participate in the roadmap and technical direction of the project to the extent of their contribution

[^license]: As long as they don't modify the common tools without sharing their improvements. See the details of the LGPLv3 license.

## The Open Rail Foundation
