One of the primary goals of OSRD is **railway planning accross rail network boundaries**.

For this goal to be reached, OSRD has to be compatible with all these networks, which isn't going to happen unless there's a way to consult and collaborate with railway companies and infrastructure managers.

And for their trouble helping build OSRD, these companies get a lot in return:
 - they profit from all the common development efforts
 - they can freely build on the common effort to achieve their own goals[^license]
 - they have a say in the design and direction of the project, which may otherwise be turn out to be incompatible with their own interests

[^license]: As long as they don't modify the common tools without sharing their improvements

To make sure no railway company is left behind, the Open Rail Foundation was born[^contrib].

[^contrib]: Anyone can freely contribute to OSRD without joining the foundation

## The Open Rail Foundation

The [Open Rail Foundation](https://openrailfoundation.gitlab.io/) is a non-profit commited to organize cooperative work around railway software tools.
