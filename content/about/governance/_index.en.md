Together with key rail actors, we have created an open source foundation for railways. OSRD will be the first project hosted by the OpenRail Foundation. The OpenRail Foundation initiative aims to create an open, autonomous and collaborative innovation space.
Its mission is to promote the development of open source software projects in the railway sector, as it already exists in numerous other industrial sectors like telecommunication, automotive, energy, â€¦
Let's solve problems together!
