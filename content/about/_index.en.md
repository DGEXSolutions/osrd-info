The OSRD program is composed of a set of projects, each contributing to the development of one or more solutions.

The different projects of the program complement each other to help the program achieve its ambition: <font color=#aa026d>To develop the next generation of railway design and simulation tools</font>.

You are at the right place if you want to know more about how we are organized: [Program](./program), as well as about the solutions we develop: [Project/solutions](./project/).
