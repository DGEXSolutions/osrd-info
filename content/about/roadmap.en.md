Here's a list of the big features OSRD wants to support. The order of items depends on priority (the higher the item, the more valuable it is).
This roadmap is spread over a couple of years.

- Add [ERTMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rail_Traffic_Management_System) signaling system support.
- A fine-grained permission system.
- Support cyclic train schedule. Improving Netzgrafik-Editor integration.
- Send STDCM trains to external services for storage and processing.
- Create annual transport plan service.
- Support a linear referencing [LRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_referencing) commonly used in the railway industry. Usage of [railway mileposts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone#Railway_mileposts).
- Revamp the infrastructure editor.
- New dynamic simulator. Simulate a timetable on an infrastructure and observe generated delays.
- Versioning infrastructures.
- Revamp train simulation v3.

If you'd like to push for one of these features, or if you have ideas for what OSRD could do in the future, don't hesitate to join the project!
