### Presentation

</font>

Several applications used within the SNCF group and outside need a **mapping representation of the railway network**. The OSRD base map uses geographic data from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**, a "Wikipedia of maps" that allows collaborative consultation and editing of geographic data. This base map is regularly updated to reflect the evolution of non-rail infrastructure.

"OSRD Infrastructure Management**" proposes a mapping service accessible to all and shared, based on the same model: everyone will be able to contribute and put in quality the railway data.
We provide on the one hand a **complete editor of the rail network infrastructure and the objects that compose it**, and on the other hand, **the provision of data layers for their exploitation and representation in the standards of online mapping**. Finally, we are studying the possibility of **being able to automate the updating of OpenStreetMap's railway data\*\* with the data thus made available.
