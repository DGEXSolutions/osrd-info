### OSRD: when railway simulation becomes open source

</font>

The choice of Open Source is particularly strategic in the public sector. In addition to significantly lowering development costs, it offers every citizen **the transparency needed** to understand and evaluate public investment choices.

We believe that Open Source addresses political, economic, technical and even energy issues:

- **Political**, through transparency and uniformity, because it is necessary to regain the confidence of our sponsors and because standards are struggling to be established in the sector;
- **Economic**, because a better use of the network will reduce the costs of operating and owning the network, and because the objective is to make the rail mode even more attractive;
- **Technical**, because sharing allows evolution;
- **Energy**, finally, because we can accelerate the energy transition by enhancing the value of rail transport. But we must do so while maintaining or improving industrial performance.

Finally, Open Source allows federating a community of people who worked until then in their corner. Everything is based on (Bill) Joy's infamous law: _<font color=#aa026d>«No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else»</font>_!

### Definition

</font>

Open source consists in leaving the source code of a developed software freely available, so that anyone can **read it, use it and propose modifications or developments**. The design and development of open source software is then placed in the hands of **communities** of users and/or developers.
Everyone has the ability to adapt the software to their own requirements and needs, while sharing their innovations with a large community. Development goals are therefore shared: bugs, the status of their resolution and the efforts made to solve them are public, as is the progress of new features.
In absolute terms, **anyone who wants to can contribute to the project, but this does not mean that any proposed change will be integrated:** just like peer reviews in the scientific community, open source communities have their own standards, requirements, and code reviews. The goal is clear: to ensure that the project remains of good quality.
