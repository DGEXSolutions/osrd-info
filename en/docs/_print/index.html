This example will be created step by step and explained along the way.</p><h4 id=the-infrastructure-generator>The infrastructure generator</h4><p>In the <a href=https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd><em>OSRD</em> repository</a> is a <a href=https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/tree/dev/core/examples/generated>python library</a> designed to help generate infrastructures in a format understood by <em>OSRD</em>.</p><p>The infrastructure discussed in this section can be generated thanks to <a href=https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/examples/generated/scripts/small_infra.py>small_infra.py</a> file. To learn more about the generation scripts, you can check out the related <a href=https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/blob/dev/core/examples/generated/README.md>README</a>.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=tracks>Tracks</h3></font><h4 id=track-sections>Track sections</h4><p>The first objects we need to define are <code>TrackSections</code>. Most other objects are positioned relative to track sections.</p><p>A track section is a section of rail (switches not included). One can chose to divide the tracks of their infrastructure in as many track sections as they like. Here we chose to use the longest track sections possible, which means that between two switches there is always a single track section.</p><p>Track sections is what simulated trains roll onto. They are the abstract equivalent to physical rail sections. Track sections are bidirectional.</p><p>In this example, we define two tracks for the line between the West and North-East stations. We also have overpassing tracks at the North and Mid-West stations for added realism. Finally, we have three separate tracks in the West station, since it&rsquo;s a major hub in our imaginary infrastructure.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_rails.drawio.en.svg alt="Track sections diagram"></p><div class="alert alert-warning" role=alert><h4 class=alert-heading>Important</h4><p><code>TrackSections</code> are represented as arrows in this diagram to stress the fact that they have a <strong>start</strong> and an <strong>end</strong>. It matters as objects positioned on track sections are located using their distance from the <strong>start</strong> of their track section.</p><p>Therefore, to locate an object at the beginning of its track section, set its offset to 0. To move it to the end of its track section, set its offset to the <code>length</code> of the track section.</p></div><p>These attributes are required for the track section to be complete:</p><ul><li><code>length</code>: the length of the track section in meters.</li><li><code>geo</code>: the coordinates in real life (geo is for geographic), in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON>GeoJSON</a> format.</li><li><code>sch</code>: the coordinates in the schematic view (sch for schematic), also in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON>GeoJSON</a> format.</li><li>cosmetic attributes: <code>line_name</code>, <code>track_name</code>, <code>track_number</code> which are used to indicate the name and labels that were given to the tracks / lines in real life.</li></ul><p>For all track sections in our infrastructure, the <code>geo</code> and <code>sch</code> attributes are identical, and very much resemble the given diagram.</p><p>For most track sections, their <code>length</code> is proportional to what can be seen in the diagram. To preserve readability, exceptions were made for <em>TA6</em>, <em>TA7</em>, <em>TD0</em> and <em>TD1</em> (which are 10km and 25km).</p><h4 id=track-section-links>Track Section Links</h4><p>At the moment we only created track sections, which are not connected to each other (geospacial data is not used to deduce which tracks connect).</p><p><code>TrackSectionLinks</code> are used to connect two track sections together, just like a weld joint would in real life. In an OSRD simulation, a train can go from one track section to another only if they are connected by a <code>TrackSectionLink</code> (or by a <code>Switch</code>).</p><p>To connect more than two <code>TrackSections</code> together, use the <a href=#switches><code>Switches</code></a>.</p><p>In our infrastructure, since we chose to have our track sections as long as possible, we do not actually need to use <code>TrackSectionLinks</code>.
<code>TrackSectionLinks</code> are always optional: two track sections connected by a link behave just like a single track section.</p><h4 id=switches>Switches</h4><p>A <code>Switch</code> represents just what you would expect: railway switches.</p><p>Switches can be thought of as a collections of track section links, partitioned into groups. Each group represents for a switch state. Switching group can take time, and at most one link can be ready to use at a time.</p><p>In the real world, switches are not unique, but rather instances of existing models.
Thus, links and groups are not part of the switch itself, but in a <code>SwitchType</code> object, which is shared by switches of the same model.</p><h5 id=switch-types>Switch Types</h5><p><code>SwitchTypes</code> have two mandatory attributes:</p><ul><li><code>ports</code>: A list of port names. A port is an endpoint which can be connected to a track section.</li><li><code>groups</code>: A mapping from group names to lists of links between two ports.</li></ul><p>At any time, all switches have an active group, and may have an active link, which always belongs to the active group. If there is an active link, it is active in a given direction. During a simulation, changing active link inside a group is instantaneous, but changing active link across groups takes configurable time.
This is because a switch is a physical object, and changing active link can involve moving parts of it. <code>Groups</code> are designed to represent the different positions that a switch can have. Each <code>group</code> contains the links that can be used in the associated switch position.</p><p>The duration needed to change group is stored inside the <code>Switch</code>, since it can vary depending on the physical implementation of the switch.</p><p>Our examples currently use three switch types. Switch types are just like other objects, and can easily be added as needed.</p><p><strong>1) The Point Switch</strong></p><p>The ubiquitous Y switch, which can be thought of as either two tracks merging, or one track splitting.</p><p>This switch type has three ports: <em>base</em>, <em>left</em> and <em>right</em>.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/point_switch.en.svg alt="Point switch diagram"></p><p>There are two groups, each with one connection in their list: <code>LEFT</code>, which connects <em>base</em> to <em>left</em>, and <code>RIGHT</code> which connects <em>base</em> to <em>right</em>.</p><p>Thus, at any given moment, a train can go from <em>base</em> to <em>left</em> or from <em>base</em> to <em>right</em> but never to both at the same time. A train cannot go from <em>left</em> to <em>right</em>.</p><p>A Point Switch only has two positions:</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/point_switch_positions.en.svg alt="Point switch positions diagram"></p><p><strong>2) The Cross Switch</strong></p><p>This is simply two tracks crossing each other.</p><p>This type has four ports: <em>north</em>, <em>south</em>, <em>east</em> and <em>west</em>.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/cross_switch.en.svg alt="Cross switch diagram"></p><p>It has only one group containing two connections: <em>north</em> to <em>south</em> and <em>west</em> to <em>east</em>. Indeed this kind of switch is <em>passive</em>: it has no moving parts. Despite having a single group, it is still used by the simulation to enforce route reservations.</p><p>Here are the two different connections that this switch type has:</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/cross_switch_positions.en.svg alt="Cross switch positions diagram"></p><p><strong>3) The Double cross switch</strong></p><p>This one is more like two point switches back to back. It has four ports: <em>south1</em>, <em>south2</em>, <em>north1</em> and <em>north2</em>.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/double_cross_switch.en.svg alt="Double cross switch diagram"></p><p>However, it has four groups, each with one connection. The four groups are represented in the following diagram:</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/double_cross_switch_positions.en.svg alt="Double cross switch positions diagram"></p><h5 id=back-to-switches>Back to switches</h5><p>A <code>Switch</code> has three attributes:</p><ul><li><code>switch_type</code>: the <a href=#switch-types><code>SwitchType</code></a> identifier for this switch.</li><li><code>ports</code>: a mapping from port names to track sections extremities.</li><li><code>group_change_delay</code>: the time it takes to change which group of the switch is activated.</li></ul><p>The port names must match the ports of the switch type chosen. The track section endpoints can be start or end, be careful to chose the appropriate ones.</p><p>Most of our example&rsquo;s switches are regular point switches. The path from North station to South station has two cross switches, and there is a double cross switch right before the main line splits into the North-East and South-East lines.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_rails_n_points.drawio.en.svg alt="Track sections and points diagram"></p><h4 id=curves-and-slopes>Curves and slopes</h4><p><code>Curves</code> and <code>Slopes</code> are instrumental to realistic simulations. These objects are defined as a range between a <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> offsets of one track section. If a curve / slope spans more than one track section, it has to be added to all of them.</p><p>The slope / curve values are constant on their entire range.

When a train runs into a detector, the section it is entering becomes occupied. The only function of TVD sections is to locate trains.</p><p>In real life, detectors can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle_counter>axle counters</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit>track circuits</a> for example.</p><p>For this mean of location to be efficient, detectors need to be placed regularly along your tracks, not too many because of cost, but not too few, because then TVD sections would be very large and trains would need to be very far apart to be told apart, which reduces capacity.</p><p>There often are detectors close to all sides of switches. This way, interlocking is made aware pretty much immediately when a switch is cleared, which is then free to be used again.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role=alert>Let&rsquo;s take a cross switch as an example: if train A is crossing it <em>north</em> to <em>south</em> and train B is coming to cross <em>west</em> to <em>east</em>, then as soon as train A&rsquo;s last car has passed the crossing, B should be able to go, since A is now on a completely unrelated track section.</div><p>In <em>OSRD</em>, detectors are point objects, so all the attributes it needs are its <code>id</code>, and track location (<code>track</code> and <code>offset</code>).</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_detectors.drawio.en.svg alt="Infra diagram with all detectors"></p><div class="alert alert-info" role=alert>The clumped up squares represent many detectors at once.

It&rsquo;s a good start, but meaningless until trains are made aware of it. This is where <code>Signal</code>s come into play: signals react to interlocking, and can be seen by trains.</p><p>How trains react to signals depends on the aspect, kind of signal, and signaling system.</p><p>Here are the most important attributes for signals:</p><ul><li><code>linked_detector</code>: The linked <a href=#detectors>detector</a>.</li><li><code>type_code</code>: The type of signal.</li><li><code>direction</code>: The direction it protects, which can simply be interpreted as the way in which it can be seen by an incoming train (since there are lights only on one side&mldr;).

It must be visible from the direction used to approach the switch. When there are multiple switches in a row, only the first one usually needs protection, as interlocking is usually designed as not to encourage trains stopping in the middle of intersections.</li></ul><p>Note that detectors linked to at least one signal are not represented, as there are not signals without associated detectors in this example.
To get the <code>id</code> of a detector linked to a signal, take the signal&rsquo;s <code>id</code> and replace <em>S</em> by <em>D</em> (e.g. SA0 -> DA0).</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_signals.drawio.en.svg alt="Infra diagram with all signals"></p><div class="alert alert-info" role=alert>On <em>TA6</em>, <em>TA7</em>, <em>TD0</em> and <em>TD1</em> we could not represent all signals because these track sections are very long and have many detectors, hence many signals.</div><font color=#aa026d><h2 id=miscellaneous>Miscellaneous</h2></font><h4 id=operational-points>Operational points</h4><p><code>OperationalPoints</code> are collections of points (<code>OperationalPointParts</code>) of interest.</p><p>For example, it may be convenient to store the location of platforms as parts and group them by station in operational points.</p><p>In the example infrastructure, we only used operational points to represent stations.

<font color=#aa026d><h3 id=introduction>Introduction</h3></font><p>Since physical modelling has shown that the acceleration of the train is influenced by various factors that vary along the route (gradient, curvature, engine traction force, etc.), the calculation must be carried out using a numerical integration method.

In order to decide which method would be most suitable, a study of the accuracy and computational speed of different methods was carried out. This study compared the following methods:</p><ul><li>Euler</li><li>Euler-Cauchy</li><li>Runge-Kutta 4</li><li>Adams 2</li><li>Adams 3</li></ul><p>All explanations of these methods can be found (in french) in <a href=https://github.com/DGEXSolutions/osrd/wiki/documents/integration/MethodesNumeriques_EricGoncalves.pdf>this document</a>, and the python code used for the simulation is <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/DGEXSolutions/osrd/code/integration/Tests_precision.py>here</a>.</p><p>The simulation calculates the position and speed of a high-speed train accelerating on a flat straight line.</p><h4 id=equivalent-time-step-simulations><strong>Equivalent time step simulations</strong></h4><p>A reference curve was simulated using the Euler method with a time step of 0.1s, then the same path was simulated using the other methods with a time step of 1s. It is then possible to simply compare each curve to the reference curve, by calculating the absolute value of the difference at each calculated point. The resulting absolute error of the train&rsquo;s position over its distance travelled is as follows:</p><p><img src=../precisions_h_equivalent.png alt=precisions_h_equivalent></p><p>It is immediately apparent that the Euler method is less accurate than the other four by about an order of magnitude. Each curve has a peak where the accuracy is extremely high (extremely low error), which is explained by the fact that all curves start slightly above the reference curve, cross it at one point and end slightly below it, or <em>vice versa</em>.</p><p>As accuracy is not the only important indicator, the calculation time of each method was measured.

It allows you to manipulate different space/velocity curves, to slice them, to end them, to interpolate specific points, and to address many other needs necessary for the gait calculation.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=a-specific-interface-in-the-osrd-core-service>A specific interface in the OSRD Core service</h3></font><p>The envelope system is part of the core service of OSRD (see <a href=../architecture/_index.md>software architecture</a>).</p><p>Its main components are :</p><p><strong>1 - EnvelopePart:</strong> space/speed curve, defined as a sequence of points and having metadata indicating for example if it is an acceleration curve, a braking curve, a speed hold curve, etc.</p><p><strong>2 - Envelope:</strong> a list of end-to-end EnvelopeParts on which it is possible to perform certain operations:</p><ul><li>check for continuity in space (mandatory) and speed (optional)</li><li>look for the minimum and/or maximum speed of the envelope</li><li>cut a part of the envelope between two points in space</li><li>perform a velocity interpolation at a certain position</li><li>calculate the elapsed time between two positions in the envelope</li></ul><p><img src=../envelopes_scheme.png alt=envelope_scheme></p><p><strong>3 - Overlays :</strong> system for adding more constrained (i.e. lower speed) EnvelopeParts to an existing envelope.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=given-envelopes-vs-calculated-envelopes>Given envelopes vs. calculated envelopes</h3></font><p>During the simulation, the train is supposed to follow certain speed instructions. These are modelled in OSRD by envelopes in the form of space/speed curves. Two types can be distinguished:</p><ul><li>Envelopes from <strong>infrastructure and rolling stock data</strong>, such as maximum line speed and maximum train speed. Being input data for our calculation, they do not correspond to curves with a physical meaning, as they are not derived from the results of a real integration of the physical equations of motion.</li><li>The envelopes result from <strong>real integration</strong> of the physical equations of motion. They correspond to a curve that is physically tenable by the train and also contain time information.</li></ul><p>A simple example to illustrate this difference: if we simulate a TER journey on a mountain line, one of the input data will be a maximum speed envelope of 160km/h, corresponding to the maximum speed of our TER. However, this envelope does not correspond to a physical reality, as it is possible that on certain sections the gradient is too steep for the train to be able to maintain this maximum speed of 160km/h. The calculated envelope will therefore show in this example a speed drop in the steepest areas, where the envelope given was perfectly flat.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=simulation-of-several-trains>Simulation of several trains</h3></font><p>In the case of the simulation of many trains, the signalling system must ensure <strong>safety</strong>. The effect of signalling on the running calculation of a train is reproduced by superimposing dynamic envelopes on the static envelope. A new dynamic envelope is introduced for example when a signal closes. The train follows the static economic envelope superimposed on the dynamic envelopes, if any. In this simulation mode, a time check is performed against a theoretical time from the time information of the static economic envelope. If the train is late with respect to the scheduled time, it stops following the economic envelope and tries to go faster. Its space/speed curve will therefore be limited by the maximum effort envelope.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8a7d650e7008d319d63327b9d7bb4ff5>2.2.4 - Pipeline</h1><p>The walk calculation in OSRD is a 4-step process, each using <a href=../envelopes_system>the envelopes system</a>:</p><ol><li><a href=#calculation-of-the-most-restricted-speed-profile-mrsp>Construction of the most restrictive speed profile</a></li><li><a href=#calculation-of-the-max-speed-profile>Addition of the different braking curves</a></li><li><a href=#calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile>Adding the different acceleration curves and checking the constant speed curves</a></li><li><a href=#application-of-allowances>Application of allowance(s)</a></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=calculation-of-the-most-restricted-speed-profile-mrsp>Calculation of the Most Restricted Speed Profile (MRSP)</h3></font><p>A first envelope is calculated at the beginning of the simulation by grouping all static velocity limits:</p><ul><li>maximum line speed</li><li>maximum speed of rolling stock</li><li>temporary speed limits (e.g. in case of works on a line)</li><li>speed limits by train category</li><li>speed limits according to train load</li><li>speed limits corresponding to signposts</li></ul><p>The length of the train is also taken into account to ensure that the train does not accelerate until its tail leaves the slowest speed zone. An offset is then applied to the red dashed curve. The resulting envelope (black curve) is called the <strong>Most Restricted Speed Profile (MRSP)</strong>. It is on this envelope that the following steps will be calculated.</p><p><img src=../mrsp.png alt="Most Restricted Speed Profile"></p><blockquote><p>The red dotted line represents the maximum permitted speed depending on the position.
The black line represents the MRSP where the train length has been taken into account.</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted that the different envelopeParts composing the MRSP are input data, so they do not correspond to curves with a physical reality.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=calculation-of-the-max-speed-profile>Calculation of the Max Speed Profile</h3></font><p>Starting from the MRSP, all braking curves are calculated using the overlay system (see <a href=../envelopes_system/#a-specific-interface-in-the-osrd-core-service>here</a> for more details on overlays), i.e. by creating envelopeParts which will be more restrictive than the MRSP. The resulting curve is called <strong>Max Speed Profile</strong>. This is the maximum speed envelope of the train, taking into account its braking capabilities.</p><p>Since braking curves have an imposed end point and the braking equation has no analytical solution, it is impossible to predict their starting point. The braking curves are therefore calculated backwards from their target point, i.e. the point in space where a certain speed limit is imposed (finite target speed) or the stopping point (zero target speed).</p><p><img src=../msp.png alt="Max Speed Profile"></p><p>For historical reasons in hourly production, braking curves are calculated at SNCF with a fixed deceleration, the so-called hourly deceleration (typically ~0.5m/s²) without taking into account the other forces. This method has therefore also been implemented in OSRD, allowing the calculation of braking in two different ways: with this hourly rate or with a braking force that is simply added to the other forces.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile>Calculation of the Max Effort Profile</h3></font><p>For each point corresponding to an increase in speed in the MRSP or at the end of a stop braking curve, an acceleration curve is calculated. The acceleration curves are calculated taking into account all active forces (traction force, driving resistance, weight) and therefore have a physical meaning.</p><p>For envelopeParts whose physical meaning has not yet been verified (which at this stage are the constant speed running phases, always coming from the MRSP), a new integration of the equations of motion is performed. This last calculation is necessary to take into account possible speed stalls in case the train is physically unable to hold its speed, typically in the presence of steep ramps (see <a href=../envelopes_system/#given-envelopes-vs.-calculated-envelopes>this example</a>).</p><p>The envelope that results from the addition of the acceleration curves and the verification of the speed plates is called the <strong>Max Effort Profile</strong>.</p><p><img src=../mep.png alt="Max Effort Profile"></p><p>At this stage, the resulting envelope is continuous and has a physical meaning from start to finish. The train accelerates to the maximum, runs as fast as possible according to the different speed limits and driving capabilities, and brakes to the maximum. The resulting travel calculation is called the <strong>basic running time</strong>. It corresponds to the fastest possible route for the given rolling stock on the given route.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=application-of-allowances>Application of allowance(s)</h3></font><p>After the calculation of the basic run (corresponding to the Max Effort Profile in OSRD), it is possible to apply allowances. Allowances are additions of extra time to the train&rsquo;s journey. They are used to allow the train to catch up if necessary or for other operational purposes (more details on allowances <a href=../allowances>here</a>).</p><p>A new <strong>Allowances</strong> envelope is therefore calculated using overlays to distribute the allowance requested by the user over the maximum effort envelope calculated previously.</p><p><img src=../allowances.png alt=Allowances></p><p>In the OSRD running calculation it is possible to distribute the allowances in a linear way, by lowering all speeds by a certain factor, or in an economic way, i.e. by minimising the energy consumption during the train run.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-1e84eea96c6b439c99ded337aa3be95b>2.2.5 - Allowances</h1><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=the-purpose-of-allowances>The purpose of allowances</h3></font><p>As explained in the <a href=../pipeline/#calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile>calcul du Max Effort Profile</a>, the <strong>basic running time</strong> represents the most stretched run normally achievable, i.e. the fastest possible run of the given equipment on the given route. The train accelerates to the maximum, travels as fast as possible according to the different speed limits and driving capabilities, and brakes to the maximum.</p><p>This basic run has a major disadvantage: if a train leaves 10 minutes late, it will arrive at best 10 minutes late, because by definition it is impossible for it to run faster than the basic run. Therefore, trains are scheduled with one or more allowances added. The allowances are a relaxation of the train&rsquo;s route, an addition of time to the scheduled timetable, which inevitably results in a lowering of running speeds.</p><blockquote><p>A train running in basic gear is unable to catch up!</p></blockquote><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=allowances-types>Allowances types</h3></font><p>There are two types of allowances:</p><ul><li><strong>The regularity allowance</strong>: this is the additional time added to the basic running time to take account of the inaccuracy of speed measurement, to compensate for the consequences of external incidents that disrupt the theoretical run of trains, and to maintain the regularity of the traffic. The regularity allowance applies to the whole route, although its value may change at certain intervals.</li><li><strong>The construction allowance</strong>: this is the time added/removed on a specific interval, in addition to the regularity allowance, but this time for operational reasons (dodging another train, clearing a track more quickly, etc.)</li></ul><p>A basic running time with an added allowance of regularity gives what is known as a <strong>standard walk</strong>.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=allowance-distribution>Allowance distribution</h3></font><p>Since the addition of allowance results in lower speeds along the route, there are a number of possible routes. Indeed, there are an infinite number of solutions that result in the same journey time.</p><p>As a simple example, in order to reduce the running time of a train by 10% of its journey time, it is possible to extend any stop by the time equivalent to this 10%, just as it is possible to run at 1/1.1 = 90.9% of the train&rsquo;s capacity over the entire route, or to run slower, but only at high speeds&mldr;</p><p>There are currently two algorithms for margin distribution in OSRD: linear and economic.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=linear-distribution>Linear distribution</h3></font><p>Linear allowance distribution is simply lowering the speeds by the same factor over the area where the user applies the allowance. Here is an example of its application:</p><p><img src=../python_plot_linear.png alt="Python plot linear"></p><p>The advantage of this distribution is that the allowance is spread evenly over the entire journey. A train that is late on 30% of its journey will have 70% of its allowance for the remaining 70% of its journey.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=economic-distribution>Economic distribution</h3></font><p>The economic distribution of the allowance, presented in detail in <a href=/pdf/MARECO.pdf>this document</a> (<strong>MARECO</strong> is an algorithm designed by the SNCF research department), consists of distributing the allowance in the most energy-efficient way possible. It is based on two principles:</p><ol><li>a maximum speed, avoiding the most energy-intensive speeds</li><li>run-on zones, located before braking and steep gradients, where the train runs with the engine off thanks to its inertia, allowing it to consume no energy during this period</li></ol><p><img src=../python_plot_eco_w_slopes.png alt="Python plot eco with slopes"></p><blockquote><p>An example of economic walking.

reserve infrastructure elements to allow the passage of a train.</p><p>Capacity is expressed in both space and time:
the reservation of an element can block a specific zone
that becomes inaccessible to other trains, and this reservation
lasts for a given time interval.</p><p>It can be displayed
on a chart, with the time on the horizontal axis
and the distance traveled on the vertical axis.</p><p><img src=space_time_chart.png alt="Space-time chart"></p><blockquote><p>Example of a space-time chart displaying the passage of a train.</p><p>The colors here represent aspects of the signals, but
display a consumption of the capacity as well:
when these blocks overlap for two trains, they conflict.</p></blockquote><p>There is a <strong>conflict</strong> between two trains when they reserve
the same object at the same time, in incompatible configurations.</p><p><img src=conflict.png alt="Space-time chart with conflict"></p><blockquote><p>Example of a space-time graph with a conflict: the second train
is faster than the first one, they are in conflict at the end
of the path, when the rectangles overlap.</p><p>When simulating this timetable, the second train would be
slowed down by the yellow signals, caused by the
presence of the first train.</p></blockquote><h3 id=train-slots>Train slots</h3><p>A <strong>train slot</strong> corresponds to a capacity reservation
for the passage of a train. It is fixed in space and time:
the departure time and the path taken are known.
On the space-time charts in this page, a train slot corresponds
to the set of blocks displayed for a train.</p><blockquote><p>Note: in English-speaking countries, these are often simply called &ldquo;train paths&rdquo;.
But in this context, this name would be ambiguous with the
physical path taken by the train.</p></blockquote><p>The usual procedure is for the infrastructure manager
(e.g. SNCF Réseau) to offers train slots for sale to
railway companies (e.g. SNCF Voyageurs).</p><p>At a given date before the scheduled day of operation,
all the train paths are allocated. But <strong>there may be
enough capacity to fit more trains</strong>. Trains can fit between
scheduled slots,
when they are sufficiently far apart or have not found a buyer.</p><p>The remaining capacity after the allocation of train paths is called
<strong>residual capacity</strong>. This section explains how OSRD looks
for train slots in this residual capacity.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f0e665bd09334507f4e0f2438621834b>4.2.2.2 - Train slot search module</h1><p>This module handles the search for solutions.</p><p>To reduce the problem to its simplest form and for easy and efficient

But it can be any graph that represents the physical infrastructures
and the paths that can be used.</p><p>The only constraints are: the edges must have a length, and it must
be possible to compute running time on parts of an edge.</p><h4 id=unavailable-sections>Unavailable sections</h4><p>This input encodes the areas that are unavailable because of
capacity constraints.</p><p>Every edge has a set of &ldquo;occupancy block&rdquo;. A block is made of these elements:</p><ul><li>Start offset</li><li>End offset</li><li>Start time</li><li>End time</li></ul><p>Offsets are relative to the start of the edge. Each block means that
the <em>head</em> of the train cannot be located in the edge

its speed. But it is not possible to see beyond the current edge.
This makes it difficult to compute braking curves, because
they can span over several edges.</p><p><img src=discontinuity.png alt=Discontinuity></p><blockquote><p>This example illustrates the problem: by default
the first edge is explored by going at maximum speed.
The destination is only visible once the second edge is visited,
which doesn&rsquo;t leave enough distance to stop.</p></blockquote><h4 id=solution--backtracking>Solution : backtracking</h4><p>To solve this problem, when an edge is generated with a
discontinuity in the speed envelopes, the algorithm goes back
over the previous edges to create new ones that include the
decelerations.</p><p>To give a simplified example, on a path of 4 edges
where the train can accelerate or decelerate by 10km/h per edge:</p><p><img src=backtracking_1.png alt="Discontinuity (edge version, 1/2)"></p><p>For the train to stop at the end of route 4, it must be at most
at 10km/h at the end of edge 3. A new edge is then created on
edge 3, which ends at 10km/h. A deceleration is computed
backwards from the end of the edge back to the start,
until the original curve is met (or the start of the edge).</p><p>In this example, the discontinuity has only been moved to the
transition between edges 2 and 3. The process is then repeated
on edge 2, which gives the following result:</p><p><img src=backtracking_2.png alt="Discontinuity (edge version, 2/2)"></p><p>Old edges are still present in the graph as they can lead to other solutions.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-615ce0cf6c404cd85469e6285e5feb90>4.2.2.2.4 - Conflict avoidance</h1><p>While exploring the graph, it is possible to end up in locations that would
generate conflicts. They can be avoided by adding delay.</p><h4 id=shifting-the-departure-time>Shifting the departure time</h4><p>The departure time is defined as an interval in the module parameters:
the train can leave at a given time, or up to <code>x</code> seconds later.
Whenever possible, delay should be added by shifting the departure time.</p><blockquote><p>for example : a train can leave between 10:00 et 11:00. Leaving
at 10:00 would cause a conflict, the train actually needs to enter the
destination station 15 minutes later. Making the train leave at
10:15 solves the problem.</p></blockquote><p>In OSRD, this feature is handled by keeping track, for every edge,
of the maximum duration by which we can delay the departure time.
As long as this value is enough, conflicts are avoided this way.</p><p>This time shift is a value stored in every edge of the path.
Once a path is found, the value is summed over the whole path.
This is added to the departure time.</p><blockquote><p>For example :</p><ul><li>a train leaves between 10:00 and 11:00. The initial maximum
time shift is 1:00.</li><li>At some point, an edge becomes unavailable 20 minutes after the
train passage. The value is now at 20 for any edge accessed from here.</li><li>The departure time is then delayed by 5 minutes to avoid a conflict.
The maximum time shift value is now at 15 minutes.</li><li>This process is applied until the destination is found,
or until no more delay can be added this way.</li></ul></blockquote><h4 id=engineering-allowances>Engineering allowances</h4><p>Once the maximum delay is at 0, the delay needs to be added
between two points of the path.</p><p><img src=engineering_allowance.png alt="Engineering allowances (1/2)"></p><p>The idea is the same as the one used to fix speed discontinuities:
new edges are created, replacing the previous ones.
The new edges have an engineering allowance, to add the delay where
it is possible.</p><p><img src=engineering_allowance_edges.png alt="Engineering allowances (2/2)"></p><p>computing an
<a href=https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/allowances/ title=allowances>engineering allowance</a>
is a feature of the running-time
calculation module. It adds a given delay between two points of
a path, without affecting the speeds on the rest of the path.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-ed97b39b0c3816e4f1073f363957a3e3>4.2.2.2.5 - Standard allowance</h1><p>The STDCM module must be usable with
<a href=https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/allowances/ title="marge de régularité">standard allowances</a>.
The user can set an allowance value, expressed either as a function of
the running time or the travelled distance. This time must be added to the
running time, so that it arrives later compared to its fastest possible
running time.</p><blockquote><p>For example: the user can set a margin of 5 minutes per 100km.
On a 42km long path that would take 10 minutes at best,
the train should arrive 12 minutes and 6 seconds after leaving.</p></blockquote><p>This can cause problems to detect conflicts, as an allowance would move
the end of the train slot to a later time.
The allowance must be considered when we compute conflicts as
the graph is explored.</p><p>The allowance must also follow the <a href=/pdf/MARECO.pdf>MARECO</a> model:
the extra time isn&rsquo;t added evenly over the whole path,
it is computed in a way that requires knowing the whole path.
This is done to optimize the energy used by the train.</p><h4 id=linear-margin-expressed-as-a-function-of-time>Linear margin expressed as a function of time</h4><p>As a first step, the problem is solved with a linear margin,
i.e. added evenly over the whole path.
The speed is simply modified by a constant factor.</p><p>The <a href=https://osrd.fr/en/docs/explanation/running_time_calculation/envelopes_system/ title=envelopes>envelopes</a>.
computed during the graph traversal are not modified, they are always
at maximum speed. But they are paired with a speed factor, which is used
to compute running time and to evaluate conflicts.</p><p>The final envelope, with the allowance, is only computed once a path
is found.</p><h4 id=linear-margin-expressed-as-a-function-of-distance>Linear margin expressed as a function of distance</h4><p>The principle is generally the same, but with an extra difficulty:
the speed factor isn&rsquo;t constant over the path.
When a train goes faster, it travels more distance in the same time,
which increases the allowance time and the speed factor.</p><p>Because the train speed changes over the path, the speed factor
changes from one edge to another. This causes irregular speed curves.</p><h4 id=mareco-allowances>MARECO Allowances</h4><p>This is exclusively a post-processing step,
because it isn&rsquo;t possible to compute the MARECO envelope
without knowing the full train path.
When looking for a path, linear allowances are used.</p><p>This means that conflicts may appear at this step.
To avoid them, the following procedure is applied:</p><ol><li>A mareco allowance is applied over the whole path.</li><li>If there are conflict, the first one is considered.</li><li>The mareco allowance is <em>split in two intervals</em>.
The point where the first conflict appeared is set
to be at the same time as the envelope with a linear allowance,
removing the conflict at this point.</li><li>This process is repeated iteratively until no conflict is found.</li></ol></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-460b1be4e2f2584372a451ceef833731>4.2.2.2.6 - Implementation details</h1><p>This page is about implementation details.

are explained in the documentation of those methods.</p><h4 id=heuristics>Heuristics</h4><p>The algorithm used to find a path is an A*, with a heuristic based
on geographical coordinates.</p><p>However, the coordinates of generated infrastructures are arbitrary
and don&rsquo;t reflect the track distance. It means that,
for the generated infrastructures, the path may not always be the
shortest one.</p><p>It would be possible to use this heuristic to determine whether
the current node can lead to a path that doesn&rsquo;t take
longer than the maximum allowed total run time. But for the same
reason, adding this feature would break any STDCM test on generated
infras. More details in
