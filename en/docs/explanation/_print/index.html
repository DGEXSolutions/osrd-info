This example will be created step by step and explained along the way.</p><h4 id=the-infrastructure-generator>The infrastructure generator</h4><p>In the <a href=https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd><em>OSRD</em> repository</a> is a <a href=https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/tree/dev/python/railjson_generator>python library</a> designed to help generate infrastructures in a format understood by <em>OSRD</em>.</p><p>The infrastructure discussed in this section can be generated thanks to <a href=https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/blob/dev/python/railjson_generator/railjson_generator/scripts/examples/small_infra.py>small_infra.py</a> file. To learn more about the generation scripts, you can check out the related <a href=https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/blob/dev/python/railjson_generator/README.md>README</a>.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=tracks>Tracks</h3></font><h4 id=track-sections>Track sections</h4><p>The first objects we need to define are <code>TrackSections</code>. Most other objects are positioned relative to track sections.</p><p>A track section is a section of rail (switches not included). One can chose to divide the tracks of their infrastructure in as many track sections as they like. Here we chose to use the longest track sections possible, which means that between two switches there is always a single track section.</p><p>Track sections is what simulated trains roll onto. They are the abstract equivalent to physical rail sections. Track sections are bidirectional.</p><p>In this example, we define two tracks for the line between the West and North-East stations. We also have overpassing tracks at the North and Mid-West stations for added realism. Finally, we have three separate tracks in the West station, since it&rsquo;s a major hub in our imaginary infrastructure.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_rails.drawio.en.svg alt="Track sections diagram"></p><div class="alert alert-warning" role=alert><h4 class=alert-heading>Important</h4><p><code>TrackSections</code> are represented as arrows in this diagram to stress the fact that they have a <strong>start</strong> and an <strong>end</strong>. It matters as objects positioned on track sections are located using their distance from the <strong>start</strong> of their track section.</p><p>Therefore, to locate an object at the beginning of its track section, set its offset to 0. To move it to the end of its track section, set its offset to the <code>length</code> of the track section.</p></div><p>These attributes are required for the track section to be complete:</p><ul><li><code>length</code>: the length of the track section in meters.</li><li><code>geo</code>: the coordinates in real life (geo is for geographic), in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON>GeoJSON</a> format.</li><li><code>sch</code>: the coordinates in the schematic view (sch for schematic), also in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON>GeoJSON</a> format.</li><li>cosmetic attributes: <code>line_name</code>, <code>track_name</code>, <code>track_number</code> which are used to indicate the name and labels that were given to the tracks / lines in real life.</li></ul><p>For all track sections in our infrastructure, the <code>geo</code> and <code>sch</code> attributes are identical, and very much resemble the given diagram.</p><p>For most track sections, their <code>length</code> is proportional to what can be seen in the diagram. To preserve readability, exceptions were made for <em>TA6</em>, <em>TA7</em>, <em>TD0</em> and <em>TD1</em> (which are 10km and 25km).</p><h4 id=track-section-links>Track Section Links</h4><p>At the moment we only created track sections, which are not connected to each other (geospacial data is not used to deduce which tracks connect).</p><p><code>TrackSectionLinks</code> are used to connect two track sections together, just like a weld joint would in real life. In an OSRD simulation, a train can go from one track section to another only if they are connected by a <code>TrackSectionLink</code> (or by a <code>Switch</code>).</p><p>To connect more than two <code>TrackSections</code> together, use the <a href=#switches><code>Switches</code></a>.</p><p>In our infrastructure, since we chose to have our track sections as long as possible, we do not actually need to use <code>TrackSectionLinks</code>.
<code>TrackSectionLinks</code> are always optional: two track sections connected by a link behave just like a single track section.</p><h4 id=switches>Switches</h4><p>A <code>Switch</code> represents just what you would expect: railway switches.</p><p>Switches can be thought of as a collections of track section links, partitioned into groups. Each group represents for a switch state. Switching group can take time, and at most one link can be ready to use at a time.</p><p>In the real world, switches are not unique, but rather instances of existing models.
Thus, links and groups are not part of the switch itself, but in a <code>SwitchType</code> object, which is shared by switches of the same model.</p><h5 id=switch-types>Switch Types</h5><p><code>SwitchTypes</code> have two mandatory attributes:</p><ul><li><code>ports</code>: A list of port names. A port is an endpoint which can be connected to a track section.</li><li><code>groups</code>: A mapping from group names to lists of links between two ports.</li></ul><p>At any time, all switches have an active group, and may have an active link, which always belongs to the active group. If there is an active link, it is active in a given direction. During a simulation, changing active link inside a group is instantaneous, but changing active link across groups takes configurable time.
This is because a switch is a physical object, and changing active link can involve moving parts of it. <code>Groups</code> are designed to represent the different positions that a switch can have. Each <code>group</code> contains the links that can be used in the associated switch position.</p><p>The duration needed to change group is stored inside the <code>Switch</code>, since it can vary depending on the physical implementation of the switch.</p><p>Our examples currently use three switch types. Switch types are just like other objects, and can easily be added as needed.</p><p><strong>1) The Point Switch</strong></p><p>The ubiquitous Y switch, which can be thought of as either two tracks merging, or one track splitting.</p><p>This switch type has three ports: <em>base</em>, <em>left</em> and <em>right</em>.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/point_switch.en.svg alt="Point switch diagram"></p><p>There are two groups, each with one connection in their list: <code>LEFT</code>, which connects <em>base</em> to <em>left</em>, and <code>RIGHT</code> which connects <em>base</em> to <em>right</em>.</p><p>Thus, at any given moment, a train can go from <em>base</em> to <em>left</em> or from <em>base</em> to <em>right</em> but never to both at the same time. A train cannot go from <em>left</em> to <em>right</em>.</p><p>A Point Switch only has two positions:</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/point_switch_positions.en.svg alt="Point switch positions diagram"></p><p><strong>2) The Cross Switch</strong></p><p>This is simply two tracks crossing each other.</p><p>This type has four ports: <em>north</em>, <em>south</em>, <em>east</em> and <em>west</em>.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/cross_switch.en.svg alt="Cross switch diagram"></p><p>It has only one group containing two connections: <em>north</em> to <em>south</em> and <em>west</em> to <em>east</em>. Indeed this kind of switch is <em>passive</em>: it has no moving parts. Despite having a single group, it is still used by the simulation to enforce route reservations.</p><p>Here are the two different connections that this switch type has:</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/cross_switch_positions.en.svg alt="Cross switch positions diagram"></p><p><strong>3) The Double cross switch</strong></p><p>This one is more like two point switches back to back. It has four ports: <em>south1</em>, <em>south2</em>, <em>north1</em> and <em>north2</em>.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/double_cross_switch.en.svg alt="Double cross switch diagram"></p><p>However, it has four groups, each with one connection. The four groups are represented in the following diagram:</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/double_cross_switch_positions.en.svg alt="Double cross switch positions diagram"></p><h5 id=back-to-switches>Back to switches</h5><p>A <code>Switch</code> has three attributes:</p><ul><li><code>switch_type</code>: the <a href=#switch-types><code>SwitchType</code></a> identifier for this switch.</li><li><code>ports</code>: a mapping from port names to track sections extremities.</li><li><code>group_change_delay</code>: the time it takes to change which group of the switch is activated.</li></ul><p>The port names must match the ports of the switch type chosen. The track section endpoints can be start or end, be careful to chose the appropriate ones.</p><p>Most of our example&rsquo;s switches are regular point switches. The path from North station to South station has two cross switches, and there is a double cross switch right before the main line splits into the North-East and South-East lines.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_rails_n_points.drawio.en.svg alt="Track sections and points diagram"></p><h4 id=curves-and-slopes>Curves and slopes</h4><p><code>Curves</code> and <code>Slopes</code> are instrumental to realistic simulations. These objects are defined as a range between a <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> offsets of one track section. If a curve / slope spans more than one track section, it has to be added to all of them.</p><p>The slope / curve values are constant on their entire range. For varying curves / slopes, one needs to create several objects.</p><p>Slope values are measured in <em>meters per kilometers</em>, and the curve values are measured in <em>meters</em> (the radius of the curve).</p><div class="alert alert-primary" role=alert>Mind that the <code>begin</code> value should always be smaller than the <code>end</code> value. That is why the curve / slope values can be negative: an uphill slope of 1 going from offset 10 to 0 is the same as a downhill slope of -1 going from offsets 0 to 10.</div><p>In the <a href=https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/blob/dev/core/examples/generated/scripts/small_infra.py>small_infra.py</a> file, we have slopes on the track sections <em>TA6</em>, <em>TA7</em>, <em>TD0</em> and <em>TD1</em>.</p><p>There are curves as well, on the track sections <em>TE0</em>, <em>TE1</em>, <em>TE3</em> and <em>TF1</em>.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=interlocking>Interlocking</h3></font><p>All objects so far contributed to track topology (shape). Topology would be enough for trains to navigate the network, but not enough to do so safely. to ensure safety, two systems collaborate:</p><ul><li>Interlocking ensures trains are allowed to move forward</li><li>Signaling is the mean by which interlocking communicates with the train</li></ul><h4 id=detectors>Detectors</h4><p>These objects are used to create <a href="https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/lexique-des-acronymes-sncf/table/?sort=abreviation&q=TVD">TVD</a> sections (Track Vacancy Detection section): the track area in between detectors is a TVD section. When a train runs into a detector, the section it is entering becomes occupied. The only function of TVD sections is to locate trains.</p><p>In real life, detectors can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle_counter>axle counters</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit>track circuits</a> for example.</p><p>For this mean of location to be efficient, detectors need to be placed regularly along your tracks, not too many because of cost, but not too few, because then TVD sections would be very large and trains would need to be very far apart to be told apart, which reduces capacity.</p><p>There often are detectors close to all sides of switches. This way, interlocking is made aware pretty much immediately when a switch is cleared, which is then free to be used again.</p><div class="alert alert-info" role=alert>Let&rsquo;s take a cross switch as an example: if train A is crossing it <em>north</em> to <em>south</em> and train B is coming to cross <em>west</em> to <em>east</em>, then as soon as train A&rsquo;s last car has passed the crossing, B should be able to go, since A is now on a completely unrelated track section.</div><p>In <em>OSRD</em>, detectors are point objects, so all the attributes it needs are its <code>id</code>, and track location (<code>track</code> and <code>offset</code>).</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_detectors.drawio.en.svg alt="Infra diagram with all detectors"></p><div class="alert alert-info" role=alert>The clumped up squares represent many detectors at once. Indeed, because some track sections are not represented with their full length, we could not represent all the detectors on the corresponding track section.</div><p>Some notes:</p><ul><li>Between some points, we added only one detector (and not two), because they were really close together, and it would have made no sense to create a tiny TVDS between the two. This situation happened on track sections (<em>TA3</em>, <em>TA4</em>, <em>TA5</em>, <em>TF0</em> and <em>TG3</em>).</li><li>In our infrastructure, there is relatively few track sections which are long enough to require more detectors than just those related to switches. Namely, <em>TA6</em>, <em>TA7</em>, <em>TDO</em>, <em>TD1</em>, <em>TF1</em>, <em>TG1</em> and <em>TH1</em>. For example <em>TD0</em>, which measures 25km, has in fact 17 detectors in total.</li></ul><h4 id=buffer-stops>Buffer stops</h4><p><code>BufferStops</code> are obstacles designed to prevent trains from sliding off dead ends.</p><p>In our infrastructure, there is a buffer stop on each track section which has a loose end. There are therefore 8 buffer stops in total.</p><p>Together with detectors, they set the boundaries of TVD sections (see <a href=#detectors>Detectors</a>)</p><h4 id=routes>Routes</h4><p>A <code>Route</code> is an itinerary in the infrastructure. A train path is a sequence of routes. Routes are used to reserve section of path with the interlocking. See the <a href=/fr/developers/internals/simulation-model/>dedicated documentation</a>.</p><p>It is represented with the following attributes:</p><ul><li><code>entry_point</code> and <code>exit_point</code>: references detectors or buffer stops which mark the beginning and the end of the Route.</li><li><code>entry_point_direction</code> : Direction on a track section to start the route from the <code>entry_point</code>.</li><li><code>switches_direction</code> : A set of directions to follow when we encounter a switch on our Route, to build this Route from <code>entry_point</code> to <code>exit_point</code>.</li><li><code>release_detectors</code>: When a train clears a release detector, resources reserved from the beginning of the route until this detector are released.</li></ul><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=signaling>Signaling</h3></font><p>Thanks to interlocking, trains are located and allowed to move. It&rsquo;s a good start, but meaningless until trains are made aware of it. This is where <code>Signal</code>s come into play: signals react to interlocking, and can be seen by trains.</p><p>How trains react to signals depends on the aspect, kind of signal, and signaling system.</p><p>Here are the most important attributes for signals:</p><ul><li><code>linked_detector</code>: The linked <a href=#detectors>detector</a>.</li><li><code>type_code</code>: The type of signal.</li><li><code>direction</code>: The direction it protects, which can simply be interpreted as the way in which it can be seen by an incoming train (since there are lights only on one side&mldr;). Direction is relative to track section orientation.</li><li>Cosmetic attributes like <code>angle_geo</code> or <code>side</code> which control the way in which the signals are displayed in the front-end.</li></ul><p>Here is a visualization of how one can represent a signal, and which direction it protects.</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/signal_dir.en.svg alt="Signal direction example"></p><br><p>The way the signals are arranged is highly dependent on both signaling system and infrastructure manager.</p><p>Here are the basic rules used for this example infrastructure:</p><ul><li>We add two spacing signals (one per direction) for each detector that is cutting a long TVD section into smaller ones.</li><li>Switch entries where a train might have to stop are protected by a signal (which is located outside of the switch TVD section).

To get the <code>id</code> of a detector linked to a signal, take the signal&rsquo;s <code>id</code> and replace <em>S</em> by <em>D</em> (e.g. SA0 -> DA0).</p><p><img src=svg_diagrams/small_infra_signals.drawio.en.svg alt="Infra diagram with all signals"></p><div class="alert alert-info" role=alert>On <em>TA6</em>, <em>TA7</em>, <em>TD0</em> and <em>TD1</em> we could not represent all signals because these track sections are very long and have many detectors, hence many signals.</div><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=electrification>Electrification</h3></font><p>To allow electric trains to run on our infrastructure, we need to specify which parts of the infrastructure is electrified.</p><h4 id=catenaries>Catenaries</h4><p><code>Catenaries</code> are objects that represent the overhead wires that power electric trains.

The train then makes contact with these cables thanks to a conducting piece mounted on a mechanical arm: the <em>pantograph</em>.</p><h3 id=neutral-sections>Neutral sections</h3><p>With this system it is difficult to ensure the electrical supply of a train continuously over the entire length of a line. On certain sections of track, it is necessary to cut the electrical supply of the train. These portions are called <strong>neutral sections</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, in order to avoid energy losses along the catenaries, the current is supplied by several substations distributed along the tracks. Two portions of catenaries supplied by different substations must be electrically isolated to avoid short circuits.</p><p>Moreover, the way the tracks are electrified (DC or not for example) can change according to the local uses and the time of installation. It is again necessary to electrically isolate the portions of tracks which are electrified differently. The train must also (except in particular cases) change its pantograph when the type of electrification changes.</p><p>In both cases, the driver is instructed to cut the train&rsquo;s traction, and sometimes even to lower the pantograph.<br>In the French infrastructure, these zones are indicated by announcement, execution and end signs. They also carry the indication to lower the pantograph or not. The portions of track between the execution and end may not be electrified entirely, and may not even have a catenary (in this case the zone necessarily requires lowering the pantograph).<br><em>REV</em> (for reversible) signs are sometimes placed downstream of the end of zone signs. They are intended for trains that run with a pantograph at the rear of the train. These signs indicate that the driver can resume traction safely.</p><p>Additionally, it may sometimes be impossible on a short section of track to place a catenary or to raise the train&rsquo;s pantograph. In this case the line is still considered electrified, and the area without electrification (passage under a bridge for example) is considered as a neutral section.</p><h3 id=rolling-stock>Rolling stock</h3><p>After passing through a neutral section, a train must resume traction. This is not immediate (a few seconds), and the necessary duration depends on the rolling stock.</p><p>In addition, the driver must, if necessary, lower his pantograph, which also takes time (a few tens of seconds) and also depends on the rolling stock.</p><p>Thus, the coasting imposed on the train extends outside the neutral section, since these system times are to be counted from the end of the neutral section.</p><h2 id=data-model>Data model</h2><p>We have chosen to model the neutral sections as the space between the signs linked to it (and not as the precise zone where there is no catenary or where the catenary is not electrified).</p><p>This zone is directional, <em>i.e.</em> associated with a direction of travel, in order to be able to take into account different placements of signs according to the direction. The execution sign of a given direction is not necessarily placed at the same position as the end of zone sign of the opposite direction.</p><p>For a two-way track, a neutral section is therefore represented by two objects.</p><p>The schema is the following</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#000;font-weight:700>{</span>

<font color=#aa026d><h3 id=introduction>Introduction</h3></font><p>Since physical modelling has shown that the acceleration of the train is influenced by various factors that vary along the route (gradient, curvature, engine traction force, etc.), the calculation must be carried out using a numerical integration method.

In order to decide which method would be most suitable, a study of the accuracy and computational speed of different methods was carried out. This study compared the following methods:</p><ul><li>Euler</li><li>Euler-Cauchy</li><li>Runge-Kutta 4</li><li>Adams 2</li><li>Adams 3</li></ul><p>All explanations of these methods can be found (in french) in <a href=https://github.com/osrd-project/osrd/wiki/documents/integration/MethodesNumeriques_EricGoncalves.pdf>this document</a>, and the python code used for the simulation is <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/osrd-project/osrd/code/integration/Tests_precision.py>here</a>.</p><p>The simulation calculates the position and speed of a high-speed train accelerating on a flat straight line.</p><h4 id=equivalent-time-step-simulations><strong>Equivalent time step simulations</strong></h4><p>A reference curve was simulated using the Euler method with a time step of 0.1s, then the same path was simulated using the other methods with a time step of 1s. It is then possible to simply compare each curve to the reference curve, by calculating the absolute value of the difference at each calculated point. The resulting absolute error of the train&rsquo;s position over its distance travelled is as follows:</p><p><img src=../precisions_h_equivalent.png alt=precisions_h_equivalent></p><p>It is immediately apparent that the Euler method is less accurate than the other four by about an order of magnitude. Each curve has a peak where the accuracy is extremely high (extremely low error), which is explained by the fact that all curves start slightly above the reference curve, cross it at one point and end slightly below it, or <em>vice versa</em>.</p><p>As accuracy is not the only important indicator, the calculation time of each method was measured. This is what we get for the same input parameters:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Integration method</th><th style=text-align:right>Calculation time (s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Euler</td><td style=text-align:right>1.86</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Euler-Cauchy</td><td style=text-align:right>3.80</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Runge-Kutta 4</td><td style=text-align:right>7.01</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Adams 2</td><td style=text-align:right>3.43</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Adams 3</td><td style=text-align:right>5.27</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Thus, Euler-Cauchy and Adams 2 are about twice as slow as Euler, Adams 3 is about three times as slow, and RK4 is about four times as slow. These results have been verified on much longer simulations, and the different ratios are maintained.</p><h4 id=simulation-with-equivalent-calculation-time><strong>Simulation with equivalent calculation time</strong></h4><p>As the computation times of all methods depend linearly on the time step, it is relatively simple to compare the accuracy for approximately the same computation time. Multiplying the time step of Euler-Cauchy and Adams 2 by 2, the time step of Adams 3 by 3, and the time step of RK4 by 4, here are the resulting absolute error curves:</p><p><img src=../precisions_time_equivalent.png alt=precisions_time_equivalent></p><p>And here are the calculation times:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Integration method</th><th style=text-align:right>Calculation time (s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Euler</td><td style=text-align:right>1.75</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Euler-Cauchy</td><td style=text-align:right>2.10</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Runge-Kutta 4</td><td style=text-align:right>1.95</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Adams 2</td><td style=text-align:right>1.91</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Adams 3</td><td style=text-align:right>1.99</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After some time, RK4 tends to be the most accurate method, slightly more accurate than Euler-Cauchy, and still much more accurate than the Euler method.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=conclusions-of-the-study>Conclusions of the study</h3></font><p>The study of accuracy and computational speed presented above shows that RK4 and Euler-Cauchy would be good candidates to replace the Euler algorithm in OSRD: both are fast, accurate, and could replace the Euler method without requiring large implementation changes because they only compute within the current time step.
<strong>It was decided that OSRD would use the Runge-Kutta 4 method because it is slightly more accurate than Euler-Cauchy and it is a well-known method for this type of calculation, so it is very suitable for an open-source simulator.</strong></p><style>img[src$=method]{height:70%;width:70%}</style></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-4ea0de1a5a62574096209d692bf76d42>2.3 - Envelopes system</h1><p>The envelope system is an interface created specifically for the OSRD gait calculation. It allows you to manipulate different space/velocity curves, to slice them, to end them, to interpolate specific points, and to address many other needs necessary for the gait calculation.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=a-specific-interface-in-the-osrd-core-service>A specific interface in the OSRD Core service</h3></font><p>The envelope system is part of the core service of OSRD (see <a href=../architecture/_index.md>software architecture</a>).</p><p>Its main components are :</p><p><strong>1 - EnvelopePart:</strong> space/speed curve, defined as a sequence of points and having metadata indicating for example if it is an acceleration curve, a braking curve, a speed hold curve, etc.</p><p><strong>2 - Envelope:</strong> a list of end-to-end EnvelopeParts on which it is possible to perform certain operations:</p><ul><li>check for continuity in space (mandatory) and speed (optional)</li><li>look for the minimum and/or maximum speed of the envelope</li><li>cut a part of the envelope between two points in space</li><li>perform a velocity interpolation at a certain position</li><li>calculate the elapsed time between two positions in the envelope</li></ul><p><img src=../envelopes_scheme.png alt=envelope_scheme></p><p><strong>3 - Overlays :</strong> system for adding more constrained (i.e. lower speed) EnvelopeParts to an existing envelope.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=given-envelopes-vs-calculated-envelopes>Given envelopes vs. calculated envelopes</h3></font><p>During the simulation, the train is supposed to follow certain speed instructions. These are modelled in OSRD by envelopes in the form of space/speed curves. Two types can be distinguished:</p><ul><li>Envelopes from <strong>infrastructure and rolling stock data</strong>, such as maximum line speed and maximum train speed. Being input data for our calculation, they do not correspond to curves with a physical meaning, as they are not derived from the results of a real integration of the physical equations of motion.</li><li>The envelopes result from <strong>real integration</strong> of the physical equations of motion. They correspond to a curve that is physically tenable by the train and also contain time information.</li></ul><p>A simple example to illustrate this difference: if we simulate a TER journey on a mountain line, one of the input data will be a maximum speed envelope of 160km/h, corresponding to the maximum speed of our TER. However, this envelope does not correspond to a physical reality, as it is possible that on certain sections the gradient is too steep for the train to be able to maintain this maximum speed of 160km/h. The calculated envelope will therefore show in this example a speed drop in the steepest areas, where the envelope given was perfectly flat.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=simulation-of-several-trains>Simulation of several trains</h3></font><p>In the case of the simulation of many trains, the signalling system must ensure <strong>safety</strong>. The effect of signalling on the running calculation of a train is reproduced by superimposing dynamic envelopes on the static envelope. A new dynamic envelope is introduced for example when a signal closes. The train follows the static economic envelope superimposed on the dynamic envelopes, if any. In this simulation mode, a time check is performed against a theoretical time from the time information of the static economic envelope. If the train is late with respect to the scheduled time, it stops following the economic envelope and tries to go faster. Its space/speed curve will therefore be limited by the maximum effort envelope.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-8a7d650e7008d319d63327b9d7bb4ff5>2.4 - Pipeline</h1><p>The walk calculation in OSRD is a 4-step process, each using <a href=../envelopes_system>the envelopes system</a>:</p><ol><li><a href=#calculation-of-the-most-restricted-speed-profile-mrsp>Construction of the most restrictive speed profile</a></li><li><a href=#calculation-of-the-max-speed-profile>Addition of the different braking curves</a></li><li><a href=#calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile>Adding the different acceleration curves and checking the constant speed curves</a></li><li><a href=#application-of-allowances>Application of allowance(s)</a></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=calculation-of-the-most-restricted-speed-profile-mrsp>Calculation of the Most Restricted Speed Profile (MRSP)</h3></font><p>A first envelope is calculated at the beginning of the simulation by grouping all static velocity limits:</p><ul><li>maximum line speed</li><li>maximum speed of rolling stock</li><li>temporary speed limits (e.g. in case of works on a line)</li><li>speed limits by train category</li><li>speed limits according to train load</li><li>speed limits corresponding to signposts</li></ul><p>The length of the train is also taken into account to ensure that the train does not accelerate until its tail leaves the slowest speed zone. An offset is then applied to the red dashed curve. The resulting envelope (black curve) is called the <strong>Most Restricted Speed Profile (MRSP)</strong>. It is on this envelope that the following steps will be calculated.</p><p><img src=../mrsp.png alt="Most Restricted Speed Profile"></p><blockquote><p>The red dotted line represents the maximum permitted speed depending on the position.
The black line represents the MRSP where the train length has been taken into account.</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted that the different envelopeParts composing the MRSP are input data, so they do not correspond to curves with a physical reality.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=calculation-of-the-max-speed-profile>Calculation of the Max Speed Profile</h3></font><p>Starting from the MRSP, all braking curves are calculated using the overlay system (see <a href=../envelopes_system/#a-specific-interface-in-the-osrd-core-service>here</a> for more details on overlays), i.e. by creating envelopeParts which will be more restrictive than the MRSP. The resulting curve is called <strong>Max Speed Profile</strong>. This is the maximum speed envelope of the train, taking into account its braking capabilities.</p><p>Since braking curves have an imposed end point and the braking equation has no analytical solution, it is impossible to predict their starting point. The braking curves are therefore calculated backwards from their target point, i.e. the point in space where a certain speed limit is imposed (finite target speed) or the stopping point (zero target speed).</p><p><img src=../msp.png alt="Max Speed Profile"></p><p>For historical reasons in hourly production, braking curves are calculated at SNCF with a fixed deceleration, the so-called hourly deceleration (typically ~0.5m/s²) without taking into account the other forces. This method has therefore also been implemented in OSRD, allowing the calculation of braking in two different ways: with this hourly rate or with a braking force that is simply added to the other forces.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=calculation-of-the-max-effort-profile>Calculation of the Max Effort Profile</h3></font><p>For each point corresponding to an increase in speed in the MRSP or at the end of a stop braking curve, an acceleration curve is calculated. The acceleration curves are calculated taking into account all active forces (traction force, driving resistance, weight) and therefore have a physical meaning.</p><p>For envelopeParts whose physical meaning has not yet been verified (which at this stage are the constant speed running phases, always coming from the MRSP), a new integration of the equations of motion is performed. This last calculation is necessary to take into account possible speed stalls in case the train is physically unable to hold its speed, typically in the presence of steep ramps (see <a href=../envelopes_system/#given-envelopes-vs.-calculated-envelopes>this example</a>).</p><p>The envelope that results from the addition of the acceleration curves and the verification of the speed plates is called the <strong>Max Effort Profile</strong>.</p><p><img src=../mep.png alt="Max Effort Profile"></p><p>At this stage, the resulting envelope is continuous and has a physical meaning from start to finish. The train accelerates to the maximum, runs as fast as possible according to the different speed limits and driving capabilities, and brakes to the maximum. The resulting travel calculation is called the <strong>basic running time</strong>. It corresponds to the fastest possible route for the given rolling stock on the given route.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=application-of-allowances>Application of allowance(s)</h3></font><p>After the calculation of the basic run (corresponding to the Max Effort Profile in OSRD), it is possible to apply allowances.

The train accelerates to the maximum, travels as fast as possible according to the different speed limits and driving capabilities, and brakes to the maximum.</p><p>This basic run has a major disadvantage: if a train leaves 10 minutes late, it will arrive at best 10 minutes late, because by definition it is impossible for it to run faster than the basic run. Therefore, trains are scheduled with one or more allowances added. The allowances are a relaxation of the train&rsquo;s route, an addition of time to the scheduled timetable, which inevitably results in a lowering of running speeds.</p><blockquote><p>A train running in basic gear is unable to catch up!</p></blockquote><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=allowances-types>Allowances types</h3></font><p>There are two types of allowances:</p><ul><li><strong>The regularity allowance</strong>: this is the additional time added to the basic running time to take account of the inaccuracy of speed measurement, to compensate for the consequences of external incidents that disrupt the theoretical run of trains, and to maintain the regularity of the traffic. The regularity allowance applies to the whole route, although its value may change at certain intervals.</li><li><strong>The construction allowance</strong>: this is the time added/removed on a specific interval, in addition to the regularity allowance, but this time for operational reasons (dodging another train, clearing a track more quickly, etc.)</li></ul><p>A basic running time with an added allowance of regularity gives what is known as a <strong>standard walk</strong>.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=allowance-distribution>Allowance distribution</h3></font><p>Since the addition of allowance results in lower speeds along the route, there are a number of possible routes. Indeed, there are an infinite number of solutions that result in the same journey time.</p><p>As a simple example, in order to reduce the running time of a train by 10% of its journey time, it is possible to extend any stop by the time equivalent to this 10%, just as it is possible to run at 1/1.1 = 90.9% of the train&rsquo;s capacity over the entire route, or to run slower, but only at high speeds&mldr;</p><p>There are currently two algorithms for margin distribution in OSRD: linear and economic.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=linear-distribution>Linear distribution</h3></font><p>Linear allowance distribution is simply lowering the speeds by the same factor over the area where the user applies the allowance. Here is an example of its application:</p><p><img src=../python_plot_linear.png alt="Python plot linear"></p><p>The advantage of this distribution is that the allowance is spread evenly over the entire journey. A train that is late on 30% of its journey will have 70% of its allowance for the remaining 70% of its journey.</p><font color=#aa026d><h3 id=economic-distribution>Economic distribution</h3></font><p>The economic distribution of the allowance, presented in detail in <a href=/pdf/MARECO.pdf>this document</a> (<strong>MARECO</strong> is an algorithm designed by the SNCF research department), consists of distributing the allowance in the most energy-efficient way possible. It is based on two principles:</p><ol><li>a maximum speed, avoiding the most energy-intensive speeds</li><li>run-on zones, located before braking and steep gradients, where the train runs with the engine off thanks to its inertia, allowing it to consume no energy during this period</li></ol><p><img src=../python_plot_eco_w_slopes.png alt="Python plot eco with slopes"></p><blockquote><p>An example of economic walking.
